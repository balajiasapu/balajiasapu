## Hi there 👋

# Building systems and capabilities that last
I work at the intersection of business, data, and systems. Over the last 15+ years across procurement, supply chain, ERP, BI, and data platforms, I’ve spent more time thinking about flows, constraints, and judgment than about tools or buzzwords.
This GitHub is where I work things out in the open: small, focused pieces of capability, experiments with AI-assisted development, and notes that explain why something is built a certain way, not just how.

## How I work
- **Reusability comes first**. I try to design things so that a small team, or even a non-developer, can pick them up and plug them into their own context.
- **Privacy is a default**, not an afterthought. I avoid collecting data I don’t need and prefer setups where people keep control of their own information.
- I **write things down**. Assumptions, tradeoffs, edge cases, and limitations all belong next to the code so others don’t have to guess.
- **Real-world constraints matter**. Rate limits, integrations, messy data, and team workflows shape the design more than any ideal diagram.

## What I work on
Most of what ends up here starts as a personal itch or a real-world frustration. The common pattern is simple: take a problem, solve it once, and leave behind a capability that others can reuse.
- **google_sheets_sync**  
  A small, focused module for connecting to Google Sheets with OAuth, token validation, and rate limiting, with security and behavior documented so others can use it as a safe starting point.

- **Vanilla i18n capability (early stage)**  
  A lightweight, framework-agnostic way to add multilingual support to simple apps without dragging in heavy tooling.

There will be more of these over time, each built with the idea that it should be easy to lift, adapt, and plug into a different product.

I’m deep in the world of data and AI right now and enjoy breaking problems down into small, reusable building blocks. If you’re stuck on a prototype or just want to talk through an idea, drop a note in the discussions section and we can explore it together.
