## Hi there 👋

I’m Balaji.

Professionally, I bring over 15 years of experience working across procurement, supply chain, ERP, and data analytics. I started my career by building deep domain knowledge in procurement and supply chain operations, which later led me to implement Oracle ERP for large clients. That early work grounded me in business processes, enterprise systems, and how cross functional teams actually operate at scale.
Over time, I moved deeper into data and analytics. I’ve led enterprise level initiatives that improved how organizations use data for decision making, not just reporting. The work has always been less about tools and more about designing data flows that people can trust and act on.
Today, I focus on customer data strategy, working on data integrity, accessibility, and clarity so leadership teams can make better decisions faster. I enjoy diving into messy business problems, simplifying them through data, and turning that into measurable impact. I also care deeply about mentoring and collaboration, and about raising the bar for how teams think about data and systems.

I don’t come from a traditional software engineering background. What I do bring is strong judgment around data flows, system boundaries, scalability, and real-world constraints. I spend a lot of time reviewing designs, validating logic, pressure-testing assumptions, and working closely with engineers to fix problems at the right level.

In 2025, I started using AI tools more deeply, not just for writing, but for thinking, prototyping, and system design. That led me to build my first hybrid app, Nutrition Checker, using an AI-powered development environment. The goal was not just to ship an app, but to design reusable, privacy-aware capability modules that could be useful beyond a single product.

This GitHub is where I share:
- Product and system design thinking
- Reusable capability modules built for composability
- Notes on using AI responsibly in real products
- Experiments and prototypes that explore ideas before they become roadmaps

You won’t find polished production systems here. You will find clear thinking, documented decisions, and work that is meant to be reused, questioned, and improved.
If you’re interested in product, technical program management, data platforms, or practical uses of AI, feel free to explore.
